# Nature of code

> "The world around us moves in complicated and wonderful ways. We spend the earlier parts of our lives learning about our environment through perception and interaction. We expect the physical world around us to behave consistently with our perceptual memory, e.g. if we drop a rock it will fall due to gravity, if a gust of wind blows, lighter objects will be tossed by the wind further. This class focuses on understanding, simulating, and incorporating motion-based elements of our physical world into the digital worlds that we create. Our hope is to create intuitive, rich, and more satisfying experiences by drawing from the perceptual memories of our users."

“How do we define the rules that govern the behavior of our objects?” 

“How do we implement these rules in Processing?”

An object in Processing is an entity that has both data and functionality.
A class is the template for building actual instances of objects. Think of a class as the cookie cutter; the objects are the cookies themselves.
