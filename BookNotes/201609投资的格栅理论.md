[Creating a Latticework of Mental Models: An Introduction](https://www.farnamstreetblog.com/mental-models/)

[Mental Models – Latticework Investing](http://latticeworkinvesting.com/mental-models/)

动机：探索规律，用不同学科视角理解纷繁的现象，寻找普世智慧
现状：对不同学科的理解都很浅薄，没有梳理过学科脉络和核心理论，更缺乏灵活运用
目标：理解不同学科之美，形成看待世界的综合视角，按照规律去理解、分析和解决问题

列问题

- 规律是如何帮助人理解世界的？
- 学科是如何形成、发展甚至衰亡的？为什么会按照现在所见的学科进行划分？
- 如何寻找学科的核心概念、理论？
- 每个学科的核心问题是什么？为什么这个成为核心？
- 每个学科有哪些里程碑式人物，他们做出的贡献如何促进学科发展？
- 每个学科有哪些经典模型，是如何形成的？
- 这些模型在学科内是如何运用的？
- 这些模型还可以在哪些地方运用？为什么它可以迁移？
- 有哪些在多个学科都运用良好的模型？它们是如何出现的？为什么具有通用性？
