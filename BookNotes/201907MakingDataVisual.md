# Making Data Visual

[Making Data Visual - O'Reilly Media](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920041320.do)

A good visualization design requires a deep understanding of the problem, data, and users

四要素

- 数据：有哪些数据？说明什么？数据是怎样的？重点？是如何获取的？
- 任务：要用数据干什么？
- 相关者：哪些人跟数据/问题/目标有关？他们如何理解数据和问题之间的关系？受众是谁？他会如何理解可视化结果？相关领域知识有哪些？什么样的结果对他们来说有价值？
- 可视化：如何把以上的要素整合起来？如何呈现数据可以实现目标？



operationalization in the context of visualization is the process of identifying tasks to be performed over the dataset that are a reasonable approximation of the high-level question of interest



In operationalization, there are two important types of proxies:

- A proxy task is a lower-level task that stands in for the original. The result of a proxy task reflects on the answer to the original question, but the proxy task itself is more closely related to the data; it can be accomplished with quantitative tools, such as a visualization or a statistical analysis.
- A proxy value is an attribute in the data that stands in for a more abstract concept. This can be an existing attribute, or it can be derived from the data.



refine a task: 

- objects(对象，如果明确的话，可以直接对应数据中的某一列)
- measures（评估的算法）
- groupings
- actions（要做什么？对比？识别？）



逐渐细化问题，转化为 task （define a proxy）



> Goal - Question - Metric



“The strengths and weaknesses of human perception drive much of the design of visualizations”



“The skill of visualization is in finding ways to figure out what questions can be asked of the dataset, and what visual mappings will support answering those questions”
